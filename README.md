## About
This Memory Card Game is the [second project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card) created in The Odin Project's React JS section and was created using React. The main goals were to practice using state and working with hooks in functional components. The user is presented with twelve different cards. Each time the user clicks a card, the cards shuffle and are displayed in a random order, challenging them to remember which cards they have already clicked and which they have not. Clicking a card will add one point to the score displayed at the top and will update the high score if they user's score is higher.

These are some of the challenges I faced while making this project:
- Understanding how the useEffect hook works and when the code inside it runs
